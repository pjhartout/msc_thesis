* TODO <2022-03-24 Thu> Weekly Tim meeting
** Wasserstein distance discussion
*** Persistence Fisher Kernel
*** Dive into negative definiteness of Wasserstein distance

** Perturbations
*** Apply transformation to subdomains looks easy-ish
** Experiment tracking

* TODO <2022-03-11 Fri>
** Wasserstein metric consequences
** Zernicke
** Folding energy
** Fitness stuff into future directions as separate optimizations
** TODO Wrote background

* DONE <2022-02-18 Fri> Meeting with Tim
** What I did
*** Improve graph extraction methods (still need rework)
*** Start descriptor functions and kernels
*** Start perturbations and distance implementation.
*** Proceeded as you said: barebones
**** "def func_name pass" unimplemented functions to get an idea of the architecture
**** to help visualize what the whole library will look like
** What I plan to do
*** Make custom protein object to speed up operations
*** Accelerate bare bones library to get started on the difficult & exciting stuff like:
**** protein perturbations, kernel pre-computations, computational evaluation
*** Process some of the discussion points from last week
*** Idea: get the easy stuff done asap to work on most challenging aspects (rachmachandran perturb, etc)
*** Outline lit review

* DONE <2022-02-11 Fri> Meeting with Tim
** Agenda items from two weeks ago
*** DONE Go over code implementation: pointers?
*** DONE biopandas check as substitute (more lightweight) -> not yet, seems biopandas works just fine.
*** DONE fingerprint of diagram, look at topoAE. requirement: map to 1D vector. image can also be used, in general topo features are pretty compressed representations.
*** DONE biological descriptors: look at embeddings: unirep, others? https://huggingface.co/Rostlab/prot_t5_xl_bfd maybe to compare similarity in embedding space?
*** DONE grapkel, work in graph-specific kernels.
*** DONE Google protein-specfic kernels:  SP, RW, Finger print-based kernel... all too computationally expensive?
*** DONE Check domain-agnostic perturbations
*** DONE (add to slides) Perturbations: Remove subgraphs, mode collapse and mode dropping.
*** DONE Protein folding energy: assumption, assume free-lowest free energy structures
**** FoldX gives free energy (have installed FoldX, not yet fidled around with it given priority)
*** DONE Alter the pdb filse ->  should be possible using BioPython.
*** DONE Pymol, check editors for pdb files (downloaded, still need to set it up)
*** DONE Binding pocket selection and perturbations there.
*** DONE UniProt, advanced search, catalytic sites.e
*** DONE Look for datasets in the data.
*** DONE WL kernel.
*** DONE Graph survey.
*** DONE Reddit: 12,000 graphs. 200 nodes, 250 edges. 128GB RAM. W-L kernel should run
*** DONE Kernel computation: compute distance prior to exp.
*** DONE Design perturbations for labeled graph
*** DONE Change node labels, edge features (polar > non polar)
*** DONE AA jittering
*** DONE Python handlers rachamachadran outliers
*** DONE Run Affinity Prop. on graphs and simulate mode collapse/drop on protein families.
*** DONE Run perturbation with biological + graph theoretic one.
*** DONE Check criteria to be admitted to pdb
