** Organisational
*** Thesis approval sitll pending by administration - Swantje (?) sitll has to approve
*** Git repo for all thesis-related stuff can be found here: https://github.com/pjhartout/msc_thesis
**** Can I add you + Karsten to it? Other structure needs to be adopted?
*** Error message when logging in

*** Arrange weekly updates
*** Other items?
** Datasets
*** What are the objectives of the dataset you're building?
**** A thought: since proteins are in 3D space, maybe a point cloud would be more meaningful representations to work with regarding topological methods.
**** I believe it could still work with raw graph graph data, will have to investigate
** This week's action items:
*** Implement one or more GNN from literature
**** GraphRNN, GRAN, Graph Score Matching.
***** Other suggestions?
**** Specifically, work with biological/non-biological datasets to "get the hang of it."
*** Start with synthetic datasets
*** k-NN and epsilon graph
*** Organization: make timeline for thesis, key dates.
**** Key dates,
**** What needs to be implemented
*** Midterm presentation date
*** Check Euler ressources
*** 40 Pages
*** Other suggestions?
*** Two scenarios:
**** 1:  evaluate model given model and dataset
**** 2: I have my own dataset, I want to do an analysis, find best parameters.
*** Look for detailed
