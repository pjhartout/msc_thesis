\chapter{Introduction}

% Target length: 1,5 pages.

% Graph representations encapsulates a wide variety of data. Show how they can
% be useful in biology.

% Leslie paper: even worse, depending on parametrization, different models come
% out on top. Call for principled metric design is open.

% Machine learning for graphs. Describe different tasks. Discriminative vs.
% generative modelling.

% Challenges with generative modelling assessment, especially with related to
% graphs vs images. Situate within proteins. Show that it builds on Obray et al.
