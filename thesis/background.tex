\chapter{Background \& Related Work}

This chapter introduces the core concepts built upon in this thesis and surveys
recent literature tackling the evaluation of generative graph neural networks
and the relevance of this problem in structural biology. Section
\ref{sec:background} defines core mathematical and biological concepts that will
be built upon in the thesis. Section \ref{sec:related} will discuss recent
advances in the design of measures used to evaluate generative graph neural
networks and in structural biology.

\section{Background}\label{sec:background}

The set of methods investigated in this thesis lies at the interface of
structural biology and machine learning. We start by defining some relevant
biological properties of proteins, followed by a survey various graph theoretical
abstractions derived from the protein structure. We then move on to define
generative models and the various classes of measures used to evaluate them.

\subsection{Proteins}

Proteins are large biomolecules that are formed from one or more amino acid
chain -- which is known as the primary structure. As they are synthesized by the
ribosome from RNA sequences, they fold into complex secondary and tertiary
structures. Secondary structural aspects can be shared among proteins, with
recognizable motifs conserved across different protein types and species, such
as alpha helices, beta sheets, beta hairpins, walker A and walker B motifs, etc
[CITATION]. Tertiary structures are formed
